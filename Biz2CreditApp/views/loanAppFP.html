                        <strong>In General.</strong> We are committed to protect the security and integrity of all information you share with us. We have therefore implemented a number of industry-standard security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for specified and limited business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal and business information between your system and ours, we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information, and commission a third-party system security audit once a year. However, no internet security system is 100% secure or reliable, and is also subject to the reliability of hosting services, internet intermediaries, your internet service provider, and other service providers, whose reliability cannot be guaranteed by Biz2Credit. Accordingly, when you use the Site or any Services, you accept these risks, and the responsibility for choosing to use a technology that does not provide guaranteed security or reliability.

All the credit card information processing, including PCI security standards compliance, is done at the end of the third-party payment gateway, and we do not collect or store any such information. Biz2Credit uses restrictive firewalls to protect stored data and uses 256 bit SSL certificates to encrypt data transferred between you and the Site, including credit card information. You acknowledge that Biz2Credit is not responsible for the protection of any credit card information shared on the Site, and by providing such information you expressly assume any such risk.

                    <p>* Long-Term Account Lockout.

                        <i>Mobile applications.</i> Biz2Credit also offers its BizAnalylzer service via Android and iPhone mobile telephones and tablets, which mobile Business Tool service is protected by both the Biz2Credit security features described above and those of the mobile service providers. As above, only the Biz2Credit user has password-protected access to information input into its mobile application. In order to use the mobile application, the use will need to accept "App permissions" to modify or delete USB storage, test access to protected storage, and view and test network connections. Biz2Credit's Platform includes access to a mobile application which relies on your wireless service, your mobile device's GPS antenna coverage and the wireless coverage within the area in which you are located at that time. To use Biz2Credit's mobile application, your location and caller identification must be activated to enable Biz2Credit to validate your Account, your personal login and other user information, and any Biz2Credit products or services associated with the applicable mobile device. Biz2Credit also captures other information that does not specifically identify you with respect to your mobile device settings in connection with your use of Biz2Credit's Platform via the mobile application. Mobile device information gleaned includes, without limitation, the mobile number associated with each mobile device
                         registered to your Account, the types of mobile devices used, each mobile device's unique device ID, its IP address and operating system, geo-location and date/time stamps, the type of mobile internet browsers used by and the telecommunications carrier associated with each mobile device. Because some of the communication between Biz2Credit and you occurs through your mobile carrier's network, your carrier also may have access to the information transmitted. Biz2Credit has no control over and you should contact your mobile carrier to better understand your mobile carrier's treatment of any information transmitted through your mobile device. Biz2Credit also gathers usage statistics, metrics or other data generated by your use of your mobile device. If your location is enabled on your mobile device or the Biz2Credit's products and services you order use location-enabled products or services, you will be sending Biz2Credit information that may reveal your actual location in real-time. You understand that location-based services that are provided through Biz2Credit's Platform require a location to function properly, and your use signifies your agreement to allow Biz2Credit to use your location for such purposes. If you do not want Biz2Credit to use location-based information, please refrain from using the location based service or click "DON'T ALLOW" when your mobile device requests your location-based information.

                        <i>Information for funding applications.</i> Biz2Credit may collect, but encrypts and does not store, your Social Security Number ("<strong>SSN</strong>") or Tax Identification Number ("<strong>TIN</strong>") if you complete a Funding Qualification Form in connection with Business Finance Services (as defined in our Terms of Service). Thereafter, during the loan or other funding product application process, Biz2Credit will collect your SSN, TIN and other personal and business information that is required by the lender or funding provider, but only with the applicant's prior written approval. As above, this information is always encrypted on the Biz2Credit Platform and is then provided directly to the lender or other funding provider on the funder's platform. Further, Biz2credit does not request or collect any bank account information or link to or access this information without the customer's prior written approval, and this information is in all cases encrypted on the Biz2Credit Platform. In addition, Biz2Credit does not directly accept credit card information. Biz2Credit uses a third-party payment gateway to accept credit card information for all uses on the Site, including the purchase of business plan services, credit reports and other business information provided by Biz2Credit from partners such as D&amp;B and Equifax. All the credit card information processing, including PCI security standards compliance, is done at the end of the third-party payment gateway, and we do not collect or store any such information.

                    (2) Customer will immediately notify Biz2Credit of any change in any of such Information and Documents or Customer's

                <p>
                    (3) Customer expressly authorizes (i) Biz2Credit to disclose any or all of such Information and Documents to any bank, financial institution, factor, company providing merchant cash advances or receivables financing or other business funding, or other lender (collectively, "<strong>Lender</strong>") and/or other third parties that may be involved in the provision of commercial loans (collectively, "<strong>Lender Parties</strong>") and (ii) each Lender to disclose any or all of such Information and Documents, and share any or all of such Information and Documents with other Lender Parties in connection with such potential transactions.

                </p>

                <p>(4) Biz2Credit, and each Lender and Lender Party, shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy and completeness of such Information and Documents provided by or on behalf of Customer, and Biz2Credit is not responsible for any inaccuracy contained therein that may be incorporated into an Request for Funding.</p>

                <p>(5) Biz2Credit and each Lender is expressly authorized to request, receive and forward to any Lender and/or Lender Party, as applicable, any such Information and Documents, any verification of any or all Information and Documents, or any other information or documentation as either of them may deem necessary in connection with the Request for Funding.</p>

                    (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Biz2Credit is not an agent or

                    offer may be extended, and no application for credit will be deemed completed under applicable law unless and until a Lender to whom an application for credit was submitted has determined in accordance with its customary business practices that Customer has submitted a completed application;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Lender selected by the Customer may require Customer to pay an application or other fee to cover the costs of an appraisal, credit report or other items; and<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any application for credit will be subject to final approval by the selected Lender and signed credit agreements and other related documents.

                <p>
                    (8) Customer has reviewed and understands Biz2Credit's
                    Terms of Service and Terms Agreement referenced therein (collectively, the "<strong>Terms</strong>"), which is a legally binding agreement between you and Biz2Credit, and hereby accepts and agrees to the Terms, into which these Business Finance Terms and Conditions are hereby incorporated.
                </p>

                <p>(9) Each Owner/Officer identified above represents and warrants to Biz2Credit, intending to be legally bound, that he or she is authorized to sign this form on behalf of Customer. </p>
